"""
Most of the file methods we've looked at work in a certain location in the file. .write()  writes at a certain
 location in the file. .read() reads at a certain location in the file and so on. You can think of this as moving your pointer around in the notepad to make changes at specific location.

Opening the file in w is akin to opening the .txt file, moving your cursor to the beginning of the text file,
 writing new text and deleting everything that follows. Whereas opening the file in a is similiar to opening the .txt 
 file, moving your cursor to the very end and then adding the new pieces of text.
It is often very useful to know where the 'cursor' is in a file and be able to control it. The following methods 
allow us to do precisely this -

.tell() - returns the current position in bytes
.seek(offset,from) - changes the position by 'offset' bytes with respect to 'from'. From can take the value of 0,1,2 corresponding to beginning, relative to current position and end

Now lets revisit a+
